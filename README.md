  msg2_text1 = types.Part.from_text(text="""Alright, *dale*! You wanna know the best beaches in the Magic City? Miami's got beaches for days, *miami!* Here's the lowdown:

*   **South Beach:** This is where the party's at, baby! Think Art Deco hotels, beautiful people, and a non-stop vibe. Ocean Drive is right there, so you can grab a *cafecito* or a *mojito* whenever you need a boost. Perfect for people-watching and soaking up that Miami heat. Just remember your sunscreen, *azúcar*!

*   **Key Biscayne (Crandon Park & Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park):** Ahh, Key Biscayne...a little slice of paradise just a short drive from the city. Crandon Park has calm waters, perfect for families, and you can even rent a kayak or paddleboard. Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park boasts a historic lighthouse and stunning views. It's a more chill vibe, perfect for a *descanso* (rest).

*   **Haulover Beach Park:** Okay, this one's a bit *picante*! Haulover has a clothing-optional section, so if you're feeling adventurous, go for it! But it also has a family-friendly area with picnic spots and kite flying. Something for everyone, *oye*!

*   **Sunny Isles Beach:** Known as \"Little Moscow,\" Sunny Isles is sleek and modern with high-rise condos and luxury hotels. The beach is wide and clean, perfect for a relaxing day by the ocean. Plus, you can stroll along Collins Avenue and check out the shops and restaurants.

**Cuban Cuisine:**

**Aventura Mall:** This is a beast of a mall, *mijo*!

**Brickell City Centre:** Located in the heart of downtown Brickell, this is a sleek, modern mall with a mix of luxury and contemporary brands.

*   **8:00 AM: Cafecito & Pastelito in Little Havana:** Start your day with a *cafecito* (Cuban coffee) and a *pastelito de guayaba* (guava pastry) at Versailles Restaurant on Calle Ocho. It's a Miami institution, and the perfect way to get your energy up.
*   **9:00 AM: Stroll Through Little Havana:** Explore the heart of Cuban culture! Watch domino players at Domino Park, listen to live music, and check out the vibrant art galleries.

**Cutting-Edge Japanese:**

*   **Hiden (Wynwood):** Ok, you need to plan this one *way* in advance. It's a tiny, hidden (hence the name) omakase experience. Think multiple courses of meticulously prepared sushi and Japanese delicacies. Prepare for a pricetag to match the experience, but if you are a sushi fanatic this is a must try in Miami.
*   **Zuma (Downtown):** Zuma, a Miami staple has a solid reputation for serving the best high-end sushi in Miami.

**Modern Korean:**

*   **COTE Miami (Design District):** Bringing a Michelin-starred Korean BBQ experience to Miami, COTE offers a luxurious and interactive dining experience. Premium cuts of meat are grilled tableside, accompanied by an array of banchan (Korean side dishes). It's a celebration of Korean flavors and techniques with a modern twist.

**Innovative Asian Fusion:**

*   **KYU (Wynwood):** While not strictly \"pro Asian,\" KYU's Asian-inspired wood-fired cooking is exceptional. The menu draws influences from across Asia, and the dishes are consistently creative and delicious.

**Why These Places Stand Out:**

*   **High-Quality Ingredients:** These restaurants prioritize sourcing the best ingredients, whether it's premium seafood for sushi or high-grade wagyu for Korean BBQ.
*   **Expert Technique:** The chefs at these establishments are masters of their craft, using traditional techniques to create innovative and flavorful dishes.
*   **Attention to Detail:** From the presentation of the food to the ambiance of the restaurant, everything is carefully considered to create a memorable dining experience.

**Miami \"Pro Asian Food\" Pro-Tip:** Be prepared to pay a premium for this level of culinary artistry. Reservations are often essential, especially for the more exclusive spots.

**For Ultimate Luxury & Glamour:**

*   **The Setai, Miami Beach:** This is the crème de la crème, *mi amor*. Think Asian-inspired minimalism, impeccable service, oceanfront views, and three pools. It's a splurge, but worth it for the ultimate Miami experience.
*   **Faena Hotel Miami Beach:** This place is pure art deco *extravaganza*! Red and gold accents, a Damien Hirst woolly mammoth skeleton dipped in gold, and a private beach club. It's a statement hotel, perfect for those who want to see and be seen.

**For Beachfront Bliss & Party Vibes:**

*   **The Fontainebleau Miami Beach:** A Miami icon! This hotel is known for its legendary pool scene, celebrity sightings, and lively nightlife. It's a classic Miami experience.
*   **W South Beach:** Chic, stylish, and right on the beach. The W South Beach attracts a fashionable crowd with its trendy restaurants, bars, and pool scene.

**For a More Relaxed & Intimate Experience:**

*   **The Betsy South Beach:** A boutique hotel with a literary soul. Think sophisticated décor, a rooftop pool, and a focus on arts and culture.
*   **Hotel Beaux Arts, Autograph Collection:** In the heart of downtown Miami, this hotel has a sleek and modern feel and an elevated level of luxury with access to world class sports and entertainment.

**For Design & Art Lovers:**

**Spring (March-May):**

*   **Weather:** Near perfect! Warm temperatures (70s-80s), sunshine, and low humidity.
*   **Crowds:** Moderate. Spring Break can be busy in March, but overall, the crowds are manageable.
*   **Prices:** Moderate to high. Spring is a popular time to visit, so prices are generally higher than in the summer or fall.
*   **Verdict:** One of the best times to visit Miami. The weather is beautiful, and the crowds aren't too overwhelming.

**Summer (June-August):**

*   **Weather:** Hot, humid, and often rainy. Temperatures in the 90s with high humidity can be intense. Hurricane season starts in June.
*   **Crowds:** Fewer crowds. Many people avoid Miami in the summer due to the heat and humidity.
*   **Prices:** Lowest prices. You can find great deals on hotels and flights during the summer.
*   **Verdict:** If you can handle the heat and humidity, summer can be a great time to visit Miami on a budget.

**Fall (September-November):**

*   **Weather:** Improving after the summer heat. Still warm, but less humid. Hurricane season is still in effect.
*   **Crowds:** Fewer crowds. This is a shoulder season, so you'll find fewer tourists.
*   **Prices:** Moderate prices.
*   **Verdict:** Another great time to visit Miami. The weather is pleasant, and the crowds are manageable. Plus, you can often find good deals on hotels and flights.

**Winter (December-February):**

*   **Weather:** Mild and sunny. Temperatures in the 70s-80s, with low humidity. This is the dry season.
*   **Crowds:** Highest crowds. This is peak season, so expect lots of tourists.
*   **Prices:** Highest prices.
*   **Verdict:** If you don't mind the crowds and high prices, winter can be a great time to visit Miami for the beautiful weather.

**The Miami Bot's Recommendation:**

*   **For the best balance of weather, crowds, and prices, I recommend visiting Miami in the spring (March-May) or fall (September-November).**

*   **Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami (ICA Miami):** Located in the heart of the Design District, ICA Miami showcases cutting-edge contemporary art. It's smaller than PAMM, but the exhibitions are always thought-provoking and innovative. And the best part? It's FREE!

**For a Private Collection with a Twist:**

*   **The Margulies Collection at the WAREhOUSE:** This is a hidden gem in Wynwood. Housed in a converted warehouse, this private collection features large-scale sculptures, photography, and video installations. It's a bit off the beaten path, but well worth the visit.

**For Art Deco & Design:**

*   **Wolfsonian-FIU:** Located in a historic Art Deco building in South Beach, the Wolfsonian explores the power of design to shape the modern world. The collection includes everything from furniture and posters to propaganda and architectural drawings.

**For a Unique Experience:**

*   **Rubell Museum:** Located in Allapattah, this museum showcases the Rubell family's impressive collection of contemporary art. It's known for its immersive installations and its commitment to supporting emerging artists.

**Miami Art Museum Pro-Tip:** Check the museum websites for hours, admission fees, and special exhibitions. Many museums offer free admission on certain days or evenings.

(Googling \"Golden Corral Miami-Dade County\")

Okay, *mira*: According to Google Maps, there are **no Golden Corral locations within Miami-Dade County proper.** *¡Qué lástima!*

However, there are a couple of Golden Corrals in Broward County, which is just north of Miami-Dade. The closest ones would be:

1.  **Golden Corral (Davie):**
    *   Address: 3950 W Broward Blvd, Davie, FL 33312
    *   Distance from Miami: Approximately 25-30 miles, depending on where you are in Miami-Dade.
    *   (I can provide directions if you tell me your starting point!)
2.  **Golden Corral (Margate):**
    *   Address: 5400 W Sample Rd, Margate, FL 33073
    *   Distance from Miami: Approximately 30-35 miles, depending on where you are in Miami-Dade.

So, if you're really craving that Golden Corral buffet, you'll have to take a bit of a drive north, *mijo*.

**Miami Tip:** We might not have Golden Corral *dentro* Miami-Dade, but we've got plenty of other delicious restaurants to choose from! What kind of food are you in the mood for? I can give you some *sabroso* recommendations! *¡Wepa!*""")
