I wanted to go with the wiki miami api becase i did not need a api key for it it was reely simple to use.
next I use chatgpt to help me code the test preproessing i got some SyntaxError so i had to change the code a bit but it worked after.
codeing the Synonym Generation did not take long  but i made a miskike and put my api in github but I quickly cought it and deleted the api key and got a new one I was also surpries by the output how many worlds got deletedÂ 
I am geting a lot of earror in Part-of-Speech Annotation
